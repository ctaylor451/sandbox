# > g mu master        - merge the master updates to dev
# > g push             - push changes to github
# > g co -b <feature>  - create a new feature branch and check it out
# > g mu dev           - merge dev updates to feature
# > g co dev           - check out dev branch
# > g mc <feature>     - merge feature branch to dev branch
# > g push             - push merged dev changes to github
# > g b -d <feature>   - delete feature branch after it is no longer useful
# > g co master        - check out master branch
# > g mc dev           - merge dev branch into master branch
# > g push             - push merged master changes to github
